samples taken at:
38  degrees, 04 minutes, 55.20 seconds N

on 10 August 2022 from 1920 to 1940.

There are two radios, ID #s are WRQW887-1 and -2 -- that info should be in the data along with the location and time

Some of the text messages are long strings of "A" and long strings of "F" and the word "test".  Also did the "check nearby" which should show both a transmission from one radio and a transmission from the other radio.  

All transmissions are on GMRS Channel 04.

Submit a pull request with instructions if you know how to decode these, they look like some variant of a squelch code followed by an FSK burst of some sort to me.  URH doesn't immediately identify it, but I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
